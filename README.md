# Salary Calculations Project

This is a Project to calculate the final paystub of an employee.

At the moment of development, the scalability-oriented design was focused and tried to make sure that every component can be reusable as if it was a project and a "framework" too.

#### This project aims to use HOCs ( High Order Components ) and the Atomic Design for the modularization of the code, so can be used as a guide.

# Project can be seen deployed here:
